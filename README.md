# Stack-Binary & Linear Search

Stack implementation with Binary Search and Linear Search in Python
Binary Search and Linear Search Implementation
Purpose of the Code
This project demonstrates the implementation of two essential searching algorithms:

Linear Search
Binary Search
The primary objective is to provide hands-on experience with core data structures and reinforce the concepts of searching in computer science.

How to Run the Program
Clone the repository from GitHub:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>
Open the code in any IDE or text editor that supports your programming language.
Run the code file (search.py, search.cpp, etc.).
Features
Linear Search: A simple, iterative algorithm that checks each element sequentially.
Binary Search: An efficient divide-and-conquer approach applicable to sorted arrays.
Time Complexity
Linear Search:

Best Case: O(1) (if the target element is the first element).
Worst Case: O(n) (if the target element is at the end or not found).
Binary Search:

Best Case: O(1) (if the middle element is the target).
Worst Case: O(log n) (for a sorted array).
Worst-Case Binary Search Example
In a sorted array of size 
ùëõ
=
8
n=8:

Array: [1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15]
If the target element is not in the array (e.g., 6), it will require 3 comparisons, as:

First check: Middle = 7
Second check: Middle of left sub-array = 3
Third check: Middle of the sub-sub-array = 5
